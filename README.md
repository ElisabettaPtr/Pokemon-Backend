This project requires a ".env" file, so after cloning the repository, create a new file in the project: .env

Create an empty database with PostgreSQL

In the file, create variables "URL_DB", "USER_DB" and "PWD_DB", whose values are your database url, username and password (don't use quotes or commas!!! just the name of the variable = its value)

Execute code

If any error occurs, consider realoding the project: Right-click on pom.xml>Maven>Reload project
